            <div class="note-content"><p>Comments are a great way to discuss, improve and get feedback on your online writing. Though I believe that they should be free flowing and platform-independent. Anyone wanting to participate shouldn't need to sign up for a random account before they can.</p>
<p>If you write on the web, you could make a commenting system in many ways: using a hosted service like <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> or <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/">Facebook</a>, repurpose <a href="https://utteranc.es">Github issues</a> or build an entirely <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/comment-system-firebase/">custom solution</a>. I was never fond of any of these approaches as they invariably involve a sign-up process before anyone's able to participate.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>Webmention</strong> — an open web standard for conversations and interactions across the web. It consolidates comments, likes, reposts and some other &quot;social tokens&quot; across platforms and provides developers a way to read and display them. It's a fairly new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">W3C proposal</a> drafted by the IndieWeb community, but I'm excited to see it mature.</p>

<p>Today, discussions for topics that I care about happen primarily on Twitter. So I thought it would be a really cool idea to write a Webmention component for <a href="https://www.framer.com/?via=clearlysid">Framer</a> and bring some of those discussions here.</p>
<p>I've had a blast building websites on Framer lately — the tool's gotten unbelievably good in the past few months. Having an easy to setup commenting system will hopefully bring even more people onto the platform.</p>
<p>While it still needs some polishing, my core idea already works. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.sid.me/notes/framer-webmentions">Share this article in a tweet</a> and (assuming I didn't break anything) it should reflect at the bottom of this page in ~30-45min.</p>
<p>Give it a shot, and let me know what you think ;)</p>
