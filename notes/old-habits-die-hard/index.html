            <div class="note-content"><p>What do you do after a bad day?</p>
<p>Every once in a while things go south and get too much to handle. A heartbreak, a bad meeting, an embarrassing encounter. (TODO: add Eg.)</p>
<p>Me? I tend to sleep them off. I call off all plans and instead choose to doze-off in the judgement-free embrace of my bed... postponing all my problems to the next day.</p>
<p>The coping mechanism for a day like this is to sleep it off, wake up early the next day and put in a couple of hours of pure, honest work. I find solace in this mundane routine.</p>
<p>A long shower, fresh clothes, and a peaceful scooty ride down the near-empty roads straight to office. The breeze doing wonders for my mood.</p>
<p>Just outside the building, I stop for my regular breakfast.. an idly vada combo, with small katoris of sambaar and coconut chutney + a cold coffee with one scoop of ice-cream blended in to wash it down.</p>
<p><img src="../attachments/old-habits-breakfast.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>But things felt different today, and I spend a solid 5min trying to pinpoint what.</p>
<p>The Vada? Perfectly salted.
Idly? Exactly as powdery as I like it.
Sambaar? a little too tangy for me, but it's always been.
Coffee? refreshing as usual.</p>
<p>I look around the Cafe and spot the regulars, waving hello to some of them. I notice the chefs moving with the same machine-like gusto as they've been for the past year. I see the weighing machine showing a random number like it always does, lying unused all this while.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be in order. I'm just over-analyzing.</p>
<p>I mount my scooty and ride across to the office building, nodding at security on the way. He nods back. We've been doing this for months.</p>
<p>I circle around the building, go down the ramp into the parking lot. Completely deserted: no one's here yet. That's not strange, it's to be expected at this hour. I park at my usual spot and enter the lift.</p>
<p>A brief elevator ride followed by a short walk down the hall and I'm at my destination.</p>
<p>The Headout office. Warm, empty, welcoming. I'm the first one in, as anticipated.</p>
<p><img src="../attachments/old-habits-office.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>My desk beckoned from across the hall and I walked over to settle down and unpack. Then plugged my laptop into the monitor and walked across to the pantry to grab a Munch — again, the usual.</p>
<p>Something feels off as I grab the Munch: a short wave of guilt washes over as if I'd just shoplifted something. And yet...? I trust my instinct and gingerly keep the Munch back. Maybe another time.</p>
<p>I walk back to my desk, still dazed from this oddity.</p>
<p>But oh well, it's time to power through some work. I crack my knuckles and take a deep breath.</p>
<p>I hit Cmd + Space.. type &quot;Slack&quot; and hit Enter in a few rapid keystrokes. And... nothing happens?</p>
<p>Odd.</p>
<p>I try again. And again, for good measure.</p>
<p>Is the WiFi working? Yup, connected just fine. So what....?</p>
<p>Then realization finally dawns... as do the first morning sun rays from the nearby window.</p>
<p>Slack isn't working because it's not installed on my laptop.</p>
<p>Things feel off because I'm not supposed to be here.</p>
<p>I'm not supposed to be here, because I'd left my job months ago.</p>
<p><em>I didn't work here anymore.</em></p>
<p>I'd just subconsciously walked into my old office, following a series of motions that I used to find comfort in.</p>
<p>As my head finally clears, the sun seems to widen it's smile. I smile back. How absent-minded had I been for this to happen? And that too entirely sober? No one would believe this.</p>
<p>I glance around &quot;my&quot; desk. The name next to the monitor read &quot;Dvi&quot;. I wiped that off and scribbled &quot;Nope, still Sid's&quot; with a tongue emoji, knowing it would annoy her.</p>
<p>Time to get to work. This time opting for Discord instead of Slack, where my team-comms now lived. And I start responding to pings and emails I'd been procrastinating on and dreading replying to. Things on Figma looked great and my code in VS Code flew — I was locked in.</p>
<p>As I powered through a backlog that'd admittedly grown embarrassingly large over the past week, I noticed people starting to come in slowly and being their work days. The sun grew stronger and so did my resolve.</p>
<p>A couple of hours in, I realized I felt a lot better. Mission accomplished. Time to pack up and clear out, but not before grabbing a few Munches.</p>
<p>At the pantry I run into K, our office boy, setting up the coffee machine for the day. &quot;Back to work?&quot;, he beams at me with the same enthusiasm as he's been all these months. &quot;No, just here to steal some Munch&quot;, I say and grab some with a wink.</p>
<p>We share a laugh and then I'm off. Leaving one home-sweet-home behind for another.</p>
<p>Some things never change — and old habits die hard.</p>
